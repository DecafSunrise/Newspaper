Our mission is to report to you: We cover what you care about, break big stories that hold major institutions accountable for their actions, and expose injustices that change people's lives — all while averaging over 50 million unique monthly readers.\",\n",
       " 'BuzzFeed News is the 2021 Pulitzer Prize-Winner in International Reporting, and a four time Pulitzer Prize-finalist. Our reporting has exposed the hidden death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, exploitative content on the big tech platforms, and the secrets of government officials from London to São Paulo. We have also sparked the global conversation around millennial burnout, published candid text conversations with presidential candidates, and steadfastly sued the government for evidence gathered in the Mueller investigation — resulting in the release of thousands of documents that are integral to understanding a major chapter of American history. And BuzzFeed News reporting freed a man from prison, and helped exonerate nine others.',\n",

BuzzFeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists were also named as a finalist in the same category for one of the largest journalistic efforts ever, the FinCEN Files, which revealed how the giants of Western banking move trillions of dollars in suspicious transactions around the world while the US government does little to stop it.',\n",
       " 'The 2021 honors marks the first Pulitzer Prize win for BuzzFeed News, and its fourth time as a finalist. Previously, BuzzFeed News was a 2018 International Reporting finalist for linking more than a dozen deaths on British and US soil to the Kremlin’s targeted assassination program, and a 2017 International Reporting finalist for an exposé on how corporations use an extraordinarily powerful dispute-settlement process to bend whole countries to their will.',\n",

Dragun unzips and glances over at two patrons on either side of her before telling them, \"Mine's bigger.\"\\n\\nSeveral high-profile figures applauded the announcement. \"Get ready to make 1 mill your first 48 hours,\" wrote fellow OnlyFans model Abigal Ratchford on Instagram, while model Winnie Harlow simply commented, \"Sickening.\"\\n\\nSubscriptions to her account start at $24 a month. \"Never thought I would do this on the internet,\" one of the paywalled posts reads. \"Lowkey excited.\"\\n\\nDragun was a pivotal member of YouTube's beauty community, where she then parlayed her fame onto TikTok as a member of The Hype House. She is also the owner of the cosmetics brand Dragun Beauty, though no products are currently available for sale on the brand's website.\\n\\nThe announcement marks Dragun's first posts on social media since November, when she was arrested for felony assault on a police officer in Florida. At the time, her reps told Insider she was held in a men's jail unit, a fact she echoed during an appearance in bond court, when she tearfully asked the judge, \"Do I have to stay here in the men's unit still?\"\\n\\nThe Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Department disputed this account. \"Inmate Dragun never made it beyond the booking process prior to release; therefore, she was never placed in a men's unit,\" the institution claimed in a statement.\\n\\nIn recent years, Dragun has been open about her mental health struggles. In 2021 she was involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital for eight days after being picked up by police on Thanksgiving in her home state of Virginia. \"There is never any shame in facing struggles with your mental health. Please know that you are not alone,\" she wrote in Instagram Stories at the time.\\n\\nInsider has reached out to Dragun and her reps for comment.

       "LeBron Hill\\n\\nNashville Tennessean\\n\\nThere was this giant hill near my grandmother’s apartment complex in Tullahoma, Tennessee. My 9-year-old self, enamored by the cartoon show \"Rocket Power\" and the video game \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,\" thought it would be a great idea to try skateboarding on this hill.\\n\\nNo pads, no helmet, just a $20 skateboard I bought at Walmart and Lupe Fiasco’s “Kick, Push” playing in my headphones. I pushed off the ground and made my way down the hill. My balance, much like my judgment, failed me and after three seconds on the board I went tumbling down the concrete hill scraping my knee.

       "Tom Brady announced his (second) retirement from the NFL on Wednesday, vowing on social media, \"I'm retiring – for good.\\n\\n\"I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning, I figured I'd just press record and let you guys know first. I won't be long-winded. You only get one super emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn't change a thing.\"\\n\\nBut this is still a very big deal, and we could go on forever whilst sifting through a 23-year career the likes of which has never been seen in the NFL and probably won't be again.\\n\\nBut here's my attempt to distill TB12's accomplishments down to his 12 most memorable \"moments\":\\n\\nSuper Bowl Central: Super Bowl 57 odds, Eagles-Chiefs matchups, stats and more\\n\\n12. Mike Evans chucking notable Brady footballs\\n\\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers' perennial Pro Bowl receiver, who gifts balls he catches for touchdowns to lucky fans in the stands, accidentally gave away Brady's 600th career TD pass and also what was initially thought to be TB12's final TD throw, a 55-yarder in the 2021 divisional-round playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams. (No word on the whereabouts of the 8-yard touchdown TE Cameron Brate snared – the 737th, playoffs included, of Brady's career – at the end of the Bucs' wild-card loss to the Dallas Cowboys last month.)\\n\\n11. The many facets of Super Bowl 52\\n\\nIt was the only time Brady lost on Super Sunday ... when not playing the New York Giants. The eventful 41-33 setback to the Philadelphia Eagles included a wide-open TB12 dropping a pass in the flat from WR Danny Amendola early in the second quarter for what would have been a massive gain on third-and-5. It happened six years after Brady's former wife, Gisele Bündchen, notoriously complained, \"My husband can not (expletive) throw the ball and catch the ball at the same time\" after some infamous New England drops, including WR Wes Welker's, in Super Bowl 46.\\n\\nYet Brady passed for a Super Bowl record 505 yards (with 3 TDs) in Super Bowl 52 and brought New England back from a 12-point first-half hole, the Patriots leading 33-32 in the fourth quarter before succumbing. In one of the more entertaining games in league history, Brady provided nearly half of the game's 1,151 combined yards – an NFL record for one game.\\n\\n10. Ending Tebowmania\\n\\nOn Jan. 14, 2012, Brady tied a playoff record with six touchdown passes (half to second-year TE Rob Gronkowski) in a 45-10 divisional playoff rout of the Broncos, which also ended Tim Tebow's lone magical season as Denver's starting quarterback. The Patriots lost Super Bowl 46 three weeks later.\\n\\n9. Brady vs. Peyton\\n\\nAdmittedly, not a self-contained \"moment\" per se. But how does one encapsulate TB12's 15-year rivalry with Peyton Manning, the NFL's version of Magic and Bird? Brady won 11 of the 17 matchups, though lost his final three postseason battles against the five-time league MVP. However, the tone was really set in the 2003 and 2004 AFC championship games – Manning the MVP both of those years – but the Brady-led Pats prevailing in both contests as he played with \"Patriot Way\" efficiency while Manning was hounded into poor performances by the New England defense.\\n\\n8. 2018 AFC championship game\\n\\nIt wasn't Brady's greatest season or his greatest playoff performance, one that included a pair of interceptions. But he was vintage TB12 while orchestrating a game-winning, 65-yard drive in overtime at Arrowhead Stadium as the Patriots defeated the Kansas City Chiefs and league MVP Patrick Mahomes 37-31. It was only the second time Brady started and finished an AFC title game on the road that ended in victory and was a precursor to his final Super Bowl win with New England.\\n\\nNATE DAVIS:Winners, losers of TB12's retirement announcement range from field to broadcast booth\\n\\nNANCY ARMOUR:Tom Brady 'wouldn't change a thing.' I hope he always feels that about his NFL career\\n\\n7. 2003-2004 Patriots\\n\\nCertainly a protracted \"moment,\" but one worth noting given what the Patriots accomplished. The 2003 and 2004 teams were the bookends of the most recent Super Bowl repeat. They also set a record for the longest regular-season win streak in NFL history (18) – one broken four years later by Brady and Co. – and a 21-game win streak, playoffs included, that still stands. Arguably the peak of the longest dynastic run in league annals.\\n\\n6. 'Deflategate' revenge tour\\n\\nIn one of the odder – dare we say, overblown – controversies in NFL history, Brady began the 2016 season serving a four-game suspension for his role in whatever happened with the air pressure adjustments of footballs in New England's 45-7 dismantling of Andrew Luck's Indianapolis Colts in the 2014 AFC championship game. And this isn't to absolve Brady, destroyed cell phone and all, from whatever his part was in a sideshow that cost him more field time than other players who have committed more egregious infractions, whether on the field or off. Regardless, his penalty served, Brady was still the runner-up for league MVP honors – winning 14 of his 15 starts, including a victory in Super Bowl 51 (more on that later). His 28-to-2 touchdown-to-interception ratio in the regular season was a personal best.\\n\\nCHRIS BUMBACA:Brady retirement puts Fox in tough situation with Greg Olsen, lead NFL analyst job\\n\\nMORE:Tom Brady's stats, records – and the teams he loved and hated to face\\n\\n5. 2007 season\\n\\nWhen a guy's already won three Super Bowls, you can't deem his eighth NFL season a coming-out party. But it definitely signaled Brady's arrival as the centerpiece of the Patriots. On the way to his initial league MVP award, TB12 also became the first player to ever throw 50 touchdown passes in a season – 23 going to Hall of Famer Randy Moss, the most any player has ever caught in a campaign. New England also completed the only 16-0 regular season in NFL history, though the team's bid to finish 19-0 came up short after losing Super Bowl 42 to the underdog Giants.\\n\\n4. Super Bowl 55\\n\\nBrady's first year in Tampa ... ended in Tampa, the Bucs becoming the first team ever to win the Super Bowl on their home field. He passed for 201 yards and three TDs to win his fifth and final Super Bowl MVP nod, even if the Tampa Bay defense was arguably more deserving of the honorific after making Mahomes' life miserable in the Buccaneers' 31-9 rollover of the Chiefs.\\n\\n3. 'Tuck Rule' game\\n\\nThere was no such thing as a viral moment in 2002. But had there been, this infamous sequence would have qualified. Oakland CB Charles Woodson seemed to make a decisive strip sack of Brady with 1:50 remaining in TB12's first playoff game, a divisional round matchup with the Raiders that also served as the final contest played at New England's Foxboro Stadium. Brady and the Patriots, trailing 13-10, walked off the field thinking their season was probably over. But instant replay overturned the fumble, ruling Brady tucked the ball back into his body, thus rendering the play an incomplete pass. New England tied the game five plays later before winning in overtime.\\n\\nWith the passage of time, Brady and Woodson, teammates at the University of Michigan, have had fun reflecting on the game and even participated in an ESPN \"30 for 30\" documentary about it. Little surprise Woodson feels the Raiders were robbed to this day ... while Brady nods and winks about a defining moment while not quite bringing himself to admit a turnover.\\n\\n2. Super Bowl 36\\n\\nTwo weeks after escaping Woodson's Raiders, Brady capped his first season as an NFL starter with a win in the Super Bowl. Maybe that game's most memorable footage occurred in the tunnel pregame, an overhyped Brady head-butting teammates while waiting to take the field. OLB Willie McGinest and QB Drew Bledsoe, whom Brady replaced after his scary early season injury, had to calm down the 24-year-old. Mission accomplished. Brady passed for one TD and a modest 145 yards, though 53 came on New England's final possession – which ended with Adam Vinatieri's 48-yard field goal at the gun as the Patriots upset the heavily favored St. Louis Rams 20-17 for the first championship in franchise history. Brady was the game's MVP.\\n\\n1. 28-3\\n\\nIn many ways, Super Bowl 51 has become a meme due to the 25-point second-half deficit the Patriots faced against the Atlanta Falcons. The Boston Globe even ran early editions with the headline “A BITTER END,” showing Brady crumpled to the turf as CB Robert Alford set sail on an 82-yard pick six that gave the Falcons a 21-0 lead before halftime. Oops.\\n\\nThe rest is vintage Brady, who passed for 466 yards and two touchdowns, bringing New England all the way back to tie the game 28-28 in the final minute. He had plenty of help – from WR Julian Edelman's shoestring catch of a pass deflected by Alford to RB James White's unsung heroics to LB Dont'a Hightower's strip sack of league MVP Matt Ryan in the fourth quarter. But there was game MVP Brady, calmly throwing for 50 yards on the only overtime drive in Super Bowl history before handing it off to White for the game-winning TD.\\n\\n***\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.    1\n",

Ukraine has been concentrating considerably more on long-range missiles, additional ammunition, air defenses, and tanks\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden answered a question about whether the U.S. would give Ukraine F-16’s on Monday with a flat “no.”\\n\\nAlthough, when asked on Tuesday whether he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy while he is lobbying for the fighter jets, he said that they are going to talk soon.\\n\\nThe belief in Kyiv that the Ukrainians can eventually secure weapons systems that were once seen as a red line by the west appears to be a major driving force behind Ukraine’s renewed public push for the planes, which the country’s foreign minister publicly described as a “priority” on Tuesday.\\n\\n“What is impossible today is absolutely possible tomorrow,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Tuesday.\\n\\n“One year ago everyone rejected HIMARS and no one could imagine Abrams tanks,” another Ukrainian official had said.\\n\\nUkrainian persistence has seemingly paid off. They have so far received German and U.S. heavy tanks along with the Patriot air defense battery, which the U.S. was first reluctant to send, along with billions of dollars in military aide and supplies.
